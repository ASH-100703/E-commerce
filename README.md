## Project Overview

This project provides a basic functional e-commerce storefront. It allows users to browse products, view product details, add items to a shopping cart, and proceed to a checkout process. The product data is stored in a SQLite database, managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy. The application emphasizes clarity and simplicity, making it a good starting point for understanding Flask web applications.

## Features

* **Product Catalog:** Display a list of available products on the homepage.
* **Product Details:** Dedicated page for each product with more information.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to a session-based shopping cart and manage quantities.
* **Cart Management:** View items in the cart, adjust quantities, and see their total price.
* **Checkout Process:** A simple form to simulate placing an order.
* **Database Integration:** Products are stored persistently using SQLite and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
* **Static File Serving:** Serves static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images (e.g., product images from `static/images/`).
* **Flash Messages:** Provides user feedback for actions (e.g., "Item added to cart!").
